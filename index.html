        <p> I love to play football because football is a team game and it requires all the players to work in a team to win a match. Football helped me greatly in terms of getting stronger legs and the coordination between my legs, thighs, chest, head and to some extent, arms. There are so many tricks to learn in football that the 'beautiful game' never gets old for me. I started playing football from the age of 3, and when I was 4 I joined my first academy. By the age of 8 I left muy old academy and joined a new one. Now my father owns his own academy and my grandfather and father own there own club called Royal Rangers.
